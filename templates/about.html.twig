			<dt>What is it</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>This website provides you with a possibility to see which Usergroups are
					available in your area as well as contact-informations for each of these usergroups.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>Who is displayed?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Every PHP-Usergroup worldwide <a href="{{ url_for('team') }}">we</a> know about.</p>
				<p>If <strong>you</strong> know of a PHP-Usergroup that is not listed, then please extend
					our knowledge <span style="text-decoration: line-through">by either using the <a href="{{ url_for('promote')}}">promotion-form</a> or</span> by <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">providing us</a> with some informations
					about that Usergroup. Please provide at least
					a short name, a location, a website and  some contact-information like
					email-address, IM-Infos or mastodon-account.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>Who benefits from it?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Clearly you, as you can check which Usergroup is near you!</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>Who uses it?</dt>
			<dd>The Whole PHP-Community. The data is available via an API which is
				already being used to show the list of usergroups on the
				<a href="http://www.php.net/ug.php">PHP.net</a>-Website
			</dd>
			<dt>Who pays for it?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Simple Question, simple answer - No one pays for it.</p><p> Well, obviously
					someone has to pay for hosting etc, but that's our own private fun. There is
					no company involved behind the scenes and no sponsorship that would benefit
					from this WebSite. If you want to help us out with the bills feel free to <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">contact us</a></p>
			</dd>
			<dt id="access">Access</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Access to the group and its informations should be free for everyone.
				</p>
				<p>That
					we do not want to pay for informations about a certain usergroup
					seems to be obvious. But do you want to register for a certain
					service just to find out whether a group is meeting today or not?
					And not everyone is on Instagram, WhatsApp, Linkedin or Xing (just to
					name a few). So please keep the basic informations about your group
					freely accessible.</p>
				<p>That also means that no one should need to pay for attendance
					of a usergroup-Meeting. Of course costs need to be covered, but
					you'd better try to find a sponsor for covering the costs.
					Otherwise it seems more like a conference, doesn't it?</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>How does it work?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Whoever knows of a usergroup can promote it. You have to log in with
					a twitter-account and are then able to promote a usergroup. We will
					then check some basic stuff and might get in contact with the group
					to clear issues and as soon as everything is cleared the group will
					show up on the map.
				</p><p>
					As soon as the group appears on the map it is also available via the API
				</p>
				<p>Users whos twitter-account has been associated with a group can
					- after logging in - edit their groups information. In the groups
					information-popup there is a little edit-icon on the right hand
					side of the contact-informations. That brings you to the edit-screen.
					So <strong>you</strong> are in charge of your groups information</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Do we need an iCalendar-File?
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Short answer: No. You do not need one. But you should have one</p>
				<p>
					We use a provided iCalendar-File to retrieve your groups next meeting
					so we can display that in your groups information popup. So everyone
					interested in your group can see right from the start when and where
					your next meeting will be. No digging for new users where to find
					that information, it's right there.
				</p><p>
					As the API also provides the link to the iCalendar-file all sites using
					it might also want to display your next event beneath your username.
					This is already in progress on <a href="http://php.net/ug.php">php.net</a>.
				</p><p>
					When your groups does not have an iCalendar-File we are not able to
					provide that information, but that's it.
				</p><p>
					So even if you are meeting on a regular basis (say every last thursday
					of every second month) you should create an iCalendar-File with that
					one recurring event to give people an idea of when you are meeting.
